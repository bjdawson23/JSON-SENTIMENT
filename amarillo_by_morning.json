{"lyrics": "Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone.\r\nEverything that I've got is just what I've got on.\r\nWhen that sun is high in that Texas sky\r\nI'll be bucking it to county fair.\r\nAmarillo by morning, Amarillo I'll be there.\n\nThey took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe.\n\nLost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.\n\nWell I'll be looking for eight when they pull that gate,\n\nAnd I'm hoping that judge ain't blind.\n\nAmarillo by morning, Amarillo's on my mind.\n\n\n\nAmarillo by morning, up from San Antone.\n\nEverything that I've got is just what I've got on.\n\nI ain't got a dime, but what I got is mine.\n\nI ain't rich, but Lord I'm free.\n\nAmarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be.\n\nAmarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be"}
